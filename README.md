# interactive-form-v3

This is Team Treeouse Project demonstrating: 
1) DOM manipulation
2) Form validation through RegEx
3) Refactoring and DRYing
4) Event listening and handling

In this application, the functionality of 'real-time error messages' essentially uses the same functionality as the 'submit' event. The difference is that instead validation being checked on the 'submit' event, it is being checked on the 'keyup' event (which is every time the user presses and releases a keyboard key).
