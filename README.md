# interactive-form-v3

This is Team Treeouse Project demonstrating: 
1) DOM manipulation
2) Form validation through RegEx
3) Refactoring and DRYing
4) Event listening and handling

This application presents a webpage in which the user fills out a form. Real-time data is presented to the user for each form field. Some fields are disabled if there is conflicting data. For example, the user cannot register for two activities that occur at the same time.

In this application, the functionality of 'real-time error messages' essentially uses the same functionality as the 'submit' event. The difference is that instead validation being checked on the 'submit' event, it is being checked on the 'keyup' event (which is every time the user presses and releases a keyboard key).
