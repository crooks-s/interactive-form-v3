# interactive-form-v3

This is Team Treeouse Project demonstrating: 
1) DOM manipulation
2) Form validation through RegEx
3) Refactoring and DRYing
4) Event listening and handling

- This application presents a web form. Real-time info/validation is presented to the user for each form field. Some fields are disabled if there is conflicting data. For example, the user cannot register for two activities that have conflicting times.
<br>
- Validation is check on 'keyup' to provide 'real-time error messages.'
